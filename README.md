# Ullmann Project

Welcome to the Ullmann Project repository, a comprehensive resource for the research and data related to our project. This repository includes Cartesian coordinates of optimized geometries, an Excel file featuring both experimental and computed data, and the Jupyter notebook utilized throughout the project.

For in-depth information, please consult our associated manuscript on ChemRxiv: [Ullmann Project Manuscript](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/6532eb5cc3693ca993c1ce40).

## Contents

- **Optimized Geometries:** This section comprises text files containing the optimized xyz coordinates for all aryl-bromides, primary amines, and ligands employed in the project. These geometries were optimized at the wB97X-D/def2-SVP level using Gaussian16.

- **Data File:** Excel file containing both experimental and computed data.

- **Jupyter Notebook:** Jupter Notebook utilized for training the decision tree classifier and incorporate confidence into the prediction.
