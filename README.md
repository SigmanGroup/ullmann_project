## Contents

### Optimized Geometries
.txt files containing optimized xyz coordinates for all aryl-bromides, primary amines, and ligands used in the project. All geometries were optimized at wB97X-D/def2-SVP.
### Data File
An Excel file containing both experimental and computed data.
### Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter notebook used for data processing and modelling.
